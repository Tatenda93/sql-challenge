# SQL Challenge: Employee Database
Project Overview
This project involves designing tables, importing CSV data, and answering several analytical questions regarding employee records. The project is divided into three main parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

Data Engineering:
table schemas for the six CSV files were created using SQL.
CSV data was imported into the corresponding SQL tables ensuring proper relationships are set up with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.



Data Analysis: 

This project includes a series of SQL queries related to employee records.

Data modeling

In this section, l defined the tables and their relationships for the employee database based on the CSV files provided. The relationships are represented in an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Each tableâ€™s structure is derived from the columns and data in the CSV files.
