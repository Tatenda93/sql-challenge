# SQL Challenge: Employee Database
Project Overview

This project involves designing tables, importing CSV data, and answering several analytical questions regarding employee records. The project is divided into three main parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

Data Engineering

table schemas for the six CSV files were created using SQL.
CSV data was imported into the corresponding SQL tables ensuring proper relationships are set up with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.



Data Analysis: 

This project includes a series of SQL queries related to employee records .The queries are as follows :

1. List employee information: List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. Employees hired in 1986: List the first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
3. Manager of each department: List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. Department information: List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. Employees named Hercules: List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and last name starts with B.
6. Sales department employees: List each employee in the Sales department, including employee number, last name, and first name.
7. Sales and Development department employees: List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. Employee last name frequency count: List the frequency counts of all employee last names, in descending order.

Data modeling

In this section, l defined the tables and their relationships for the employee database based on the CSV files provided. The relationships are represented in an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Each table’s structure is derived from the columns and data in the CSV files.
